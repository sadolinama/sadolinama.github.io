# Healthcare Patient Readmission Analytics (SAS & Tableau)

## 📌 Project Overview
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a major cost driver and quality metric in healthcare.
This project analyzes patient-level hospital data to identify key drivers of readmission and
builds a risk-scoring model to support proactive intervention strategies.

## 🎯 Business Objective
- Reduce 30-day hospital readmissions
- Identify high-risk patient segments
- Support data-driven discharge planning

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- SAS (Data cleaning, KPI analysis, logistic regression)
- Tableau (Executive dashboard)
- SQL-style logic (PROC SQL)
- GitHub Pages (Portfolio hosting)

## 📊 Key KPIs
- Overall readmission rate
- Readmission rate by diagnosis
- Length of stay vs readmission
- High-risk patient percentage

## 🧮 Modeling Approach
- Logistic regression used to predict readmission risk
- Features include age, length of stay, diagnosis risk, admission type
- Patients classified into Low / Medium / High risk tiers

## 📈 Dashboard
The Tableau dashboard provides:
- Executive KPI overview
- Diagnosis-level readmission trends
- Patient-level risk segmentation

## 💡 Key Insights
- Chronic conditions (Heart Failure, COPD, Kidney Disease) significantly increase readmission risk
- Longer hospital stays strongly correlate with readmission
- Emergency admissions show higher readmission probability

## 📂 Repository Structure
See folders for SAS scripts, Tableau workbook, dataset, and final report.
